最近一直有在用英英字典來學習英語.不過有時候為了快速知道某個單詞的意思,轉而直接查看英漢詞典,比如google translate.不過我覺得如果可以,一定要培養使用英英詞典的好習慣,因為這樣可以培養自己用英語思維的好處.還有另外一個重要的原因,英漢詞典有時候翻譯過來的意思太過生硬了.舉個例子,我們來對比這個單詞: asset

從 Mac OS X 自帶的英英詞典來看:

{% codeblock lang:ruby %}

asset |ˈaset|

noun

a useful or valuable thing, person, or quality: quick 

reflexes were his chief asset | the school is an asset to 

the community.

• (usu. assets) property owned by a person or company, 

regarded as having value and available to meet debts, 

commitments, or legacies: growth in net assets | [ as 

modifier ] : debiting the asset account.

• (assets) military equipment, such as planes, ships, 

communications and radar installations, employed or 

targeted in military operations.

ORIGIN mid 16th cent. (in the plural in the sense 

‘sufficient estate to allow discharge of a will’): from 

an Anglo-Norman French legal term, from Old French asez 

‘enough,’ based on Latin ad ‘to’ + satis ‘enough.’

{% endcodeblock %}

而google　translate的翻譯呢?請看:

`名詞　财富　wealth, asset, richness`

從英英詞典的意思來看,asset還有`好處`,`優點`之類的意思.

PS. Rails的asset pipeline應該怎麼解釋呢?
